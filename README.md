# How to Run?

## Server

```
cd hocuspocus-server
npm install
node server.js
```

## Client

```
cd yjs-client
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Sanity Check

- Open two separate browser windows and navigate to the Vite dev URL obtained by running the client commands.
- Check if counters update in sync
